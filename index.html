                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>As education becomes increasingly digitized, it’s tempting to believe that simply providing students with technology is enough to level the playing field. 
                    But a deeper look reveals a different story: access to digital tools alone is not sufficient to bridge the opportunity gap. 
                    A recent study by Dr. Xin Wei from Digital Promise, which analyzed how eighth-grade students used universal design digital tools in the 2017 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) math assessment, reveals the real issue lies in how effectively different groups of students use these tools.
                    The findings show a troubling digital divide in how effectively different groups of students use technology. 
                    Although all students completed a tutorial to learn how to use each digital tool, students from historically and systematically excluded backgrounds—including those from low-income backgrounds, English language learners, and students with disabilities—tend to rely on assistive tools like text-to-speech. 
                    Meanwhile, their higher-achieving peers more frequently use advanced features such as digital pencils, which allow them to write and draw on the screen, and elimination capacity, 
                    which enables them to dismiss incorrect multiple-choice answers.</p>
